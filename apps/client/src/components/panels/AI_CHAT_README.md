# AI Chat Agent -- Architecture & Reference

The AI chat agent is a standalone panel in Wisp that provides conversational file management powered by LLM. Users can ask the agent to create, edit, move, delete, and organize files, run terminal commands, compare files, scan for duplicates, summarize documents, manage workflows, share conversations, and more.

## Capabilities

### Smart File Operations (`chat-smart-file-ops.ts`)
- **Duplicate detection**: Scans directory for files with matching sizes, groups duplicates, reports space savings.
- **Rename pattern analysis**: Detects camera timestamps, screenshot names, copy suffixes, WhatsApp media names, and suggests cleaner naming conventions.
- **Folder organization**: Analyzes file types and suggests grouping by category (Images, Documents, Code, etc.).

### Search Integration (`chat-search-integration.ts`)
- **Filename search**: Glob-based file matching.
- **Content search**: Searches inside text files for matching content with line-number snippets.
- **Combined reports**: Groups results by filename matches vs content matches.

### Document Intelligence (`chat-document-intelligence.ts`)
- **Format detection**: Identifies document types (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, Markdown, etc.).
- **Summarization suggestions**: Automatically suggests summarization for large documents in context.
- **Folder analysis**: Scans directory for documents, categorizes them, and generates overview reports.

### Code AI Actions
- **Image description**: Vision-capable models describe selected images in detail.
- **Code explanation**: Explains selected code, identifies key functions, and flags potential issues.
- **Code saving**: Assistant code blocks can be saved directly as files with auto-detected extensions.

### Git Helpers (`ai-git-helpers.ts`)
- **Commit message generation**: Analyzes staged changes and generates conventional commit messages.

### Workflow Templates (`chat-workflow-templates.ts`)
- **Built-in workflows**: Photo organization, project setup, code review, documentation generation, dependency audit.
- **Custom workflows**: Save and replay multi-step interactions as reusable templates.
- **Task plan integration**: Workflows generate task plans with step-by-step execution, pause/resume/cancel.

### Content Scanner (`chat-content-scanner.ts`)
- **Secret detection**: Scans file content for API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings.
- **Inline warnings**: Shows warnings in file action cards before approving writes that contain secrets.

### Clipboard AI (`chat-clipboard-ai.ts`)
- **Image paste**: Detects pasted images and converts to base64 for vision analysis.
- **Code paste**: Detects code snippets via heuristic language detection (TypeScript, Python, Rust, etc.).
- **URL paste**: Detects pasted URLs and extracts hostname/path metadata.

### Sharing (`chat-share.ts`)
- **Compressed links**: Serializes conversations to compressed base64 URL fragments using Compression Streams API.
- **Privacy**: Strips file paths and hidden context messages before sharing.
- **Clipboard copy**: Automatically copies share link to clipboard.

### Onboarding (`ChatOnboarding.tsx`)
- **First-time welcome**: Shows capability cards and example prompt on first use.
- **Dismissible**: Persists dismissal via localStorage so it only shows once.
- **Localized**: All text uses i18n keys for multi-language support.

## Memory & Learning

### Agent Memory (`chat-agent-memory.ts`)

The agent remembers observations per folder and globally:

- **Per-folder**: Things learned about specific directories (file patterns, organization preferences, project context).
- **Global**: User preferences that apply everywhere (preferred naming conventions, default behaviors).
- **Deduplication**: Uses Levenshtein similarity (>85% threshold) to avoid storing duplicate observations.
- **Eviction**: Entries older than 30 days are removed. Max 15 observations per folder, 50 folders, 20 global preferences.
- **Memory tags**: The AI includes `[MEMORY:folder]` or `[MEMORY:global]` tags in responses to save observations. These are stripped from the displayed text.

### Correction Learning (`chat-correction-learning.ts`)

When the user corrects the agent (e.g., "no, organize by date not by type"), the system:

1. Detects correction patterns (starts with "no", "actually", "instead", "I prefer", etc.)
2. Extracts the preference statement
3. Determines if it's global or folder-specific
4. Saves it as a memory observation tagged `[correction, preference]`

Corrections are given highest priority in the system prompt so the AI respects them.

### Feedback Store (`chat-feedback-store.ts`)

Thumbs up/down on assistant messages:

- Positive feedback reinforces the approach (saved as a positive memory).
- Negative feedback with optional correction text saves what the user wants differently.
- Feedback history is injected into the system prompt for future responses.

## Security Rules (`chat-security-rules.ts`)

Configurable rules that restrict agent actions:

- **Path restrictions**: Block actions on system directories (`/etc`, `/usr`, `C:\Windows`, etc.).
- **File type restrictions**: Prevent deleting protected file types (`.key`, `.pem`, `.env`, etc.).
- **Rate limiting**: Max mutating operations per minute (default: 20) to prevent runaway loops.
- **Configuration**: Via `/security` command or by saying "add blocked path /some/path".
- **Audit logging**: All blocked actions are logged with the blocking rule name.

## Extending the Agent

### Adding a New Action Type

1. Add the action name to `FileActionType` union in `chat-file-actions.tsx`.
2. Add it to the appropriate set (`READONLY_ACTIONS`, `ALWAYS_ASK_ACTIONS`, or neither for standard mutating).
3. Add the action name to `ALL_ACTION_NAMES` array.
4. Add parsing logic in `tryParseAction` if it has special fields.
5. Add execution logic in `executeFileAction` switch statement.
6. Add undo logic in `undoFileAction` if applicable.
7. Update `canUndoAction` to handle the new action.
8. Add the action description to `FILE_OPS_SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
9. If the action needs security checks, add it to `MUTATING_ACTIONS` in `chat-security-rules.ts`.
10. Add a mapping in `ACTION_TYPE_TO_SUMMARY_KEY` in `chat-audit-log.ts` for session summaries.

### Adding a New Slash Command

1. Add a `SlashCommand` entry to `SLASH_COMMANDS` in `chat-slash-commands.ts` (or `EXTRA_SLASH_COMMANDS` in `chat-slash-commands-extra.ts`).
2. If the command is handled client-side (no AI call), add a handler in `chat-special-commands.ts`.
3. If it uses a magic prefix (e.g., `__SHOW_*__`), the `dispatchSlashCommand` function in `use-chat-send.ts` will route it.
4. Both command sets are merged in `ChatSlashInput.tsx` for autocomplete and in `dispatchSlashCommand` for matching.

### Adding a New Proactive Suggestion

1. Create a `SuggestionGenerator` function in `use-proactive-agent.ts`.
2. Add it to the `GENERATORS` array (order matters -- first match wins).
3. The function receives `WorkspaceContext` and returns `ProactiveSuggestion | null`.

### Storage Keys

All localStorage keys are centralized in `apps/client/src/lib/storage-keys.ts`. When adding new persistent state, always add a new key there. Current AI chat keys:

- `AI_FILE_ACCESS_GRANTED` -- "Always allow" file operations toggle
- `AI_CHAT_HISTORY` -- Saved conversations
- `AI_ACTION_TEMPLATES` -- Saved action templates
- `PROACTIVE_AGENT_ENABLED` -- Proactive suggestions toggle
- `AI_AGENT_MEMORY` -- Per-folder and global observations
- `AI_CHAT_PINNED` -- Pinned messages per conversation
- `AI_CHAT_FEEDBACK` -- Thumbs up/down feedback entries
- `AI_AUDIT_LOG` -- Action audit log
- `AI_SECURITY_RULES` -- Security rule configuration
- `AI_ONBOARDING_DONE` -- First-time onboarding dismissal
- `AI_WORKFLOW_TEMPLATES` -- Custom workflow templates
